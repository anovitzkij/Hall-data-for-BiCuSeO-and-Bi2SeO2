# Hall Data Repository for BiCuSeO and Bi<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>2</sub> Oxyselenides 

This repository contains Hall effect measurement data, namely, carrier concentration and carrier mobility for *p*- and *n*-type Bi-Se-O-based oxyselenides. These datasets are provided in CSV format for ease of use in data analysis tools.

## Datasets

1. **BiCuSeO Oxyselenides**
